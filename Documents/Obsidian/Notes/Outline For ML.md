# Introduction
Machine Learning is basically the improvement of the performance of a task with experience of doing that task.

AI > ML > DL

Types of ML:
1. Supervised
 > Providing input as well as output, the mapping from input to output can be automated using an algorithm (mapping function)
 
1. Unsupervised
> Providing only an input data, and the output is a general explanation/pattern.
> a. We discover the common rules that hold true most data.(Association)
> b. Discover the grouping in the data. (Clustering)

2. Reinforcement
> Reward oriented.

# Tools to use for it
1. [Numpy](Numpy.md)
2. [Tensor flow](TensorFlow.md)
