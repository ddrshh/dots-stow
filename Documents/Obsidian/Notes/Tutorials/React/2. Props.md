Props are elements within an object that is passed into the default function of a component.

``` jsx
function Student(props){
	return (
		<h1>name is {props.name}</h1>	
		<h2>age is {props.age}</h2>
	)
}
export default Student
```

And in the `App.jsx`, we import Student as:

```jsx
function App(){
...
	<Student name="Adarsh" age=12 />
...
}
```

# Default Props 

==NOTE :==  The default Props method is deprecated and so, using the ES 6 method is recommended. 
==NOTE :==  The props object sent by `App.js`  is a const object. So, in order to add default values using ES 6 notation, we must do something like the following:

```jsx
function Card({name="Adarsh", num=21}) {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <h2> {name} </h2>
      <p> {num} </p>
    </div>
  )
};
```


# Prop Types

It is a good practice to add types to your properties. You do so by:

``` jsx
import PropTypes from 'prop-types'
function Student(props){
	return (
...
	)
}
Student.propTypes = {
	name: PropTypes.string,
	num: PropTypes.number,
}
export default Student

```

This will not stop the program from running if the types don't match, but will throw a warning and hence will help us in debugging.
