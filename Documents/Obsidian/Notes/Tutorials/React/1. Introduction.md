A react application is a Tree of components  with the app being the root, which automatically takes care of the DOM.

Lets make a `message.jsx` which has the following code

```jsx
function Message(){
	return(<h1> hi </h1>)
}
export default Message;
```

This is a function that simply returns a `h1` component.

To use this in the main app, we create a `app.tsx` where we write the following:
```jsx
import Message from './message.jxs';
function App(){
	return(<div><Message/></div>)
}
export default App;
```

Each component can be called multiple times which saves so much time.

# Program Flow
```
reactApp
	index.html
	...
	src
		main.jsx
		App.jsx
		ExtraModules.jsx
```

In a react application, the first entry point is the index.html where a `div` of id root exists. This file calls for the `main.jsx`. It looks like the following:

``` jsx
// main.jsx
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import App from './App.jsx'
import './index.css'

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
)

```

It consists of the ``React.StrictMode`` element, which is an empty element that doesn't exist in the DOM, and is mostly there for debugging purposes. It imports the `App.jsx`.

The `App.jsx` looks like the following:

``` jsx
import extraModules from 'ExtraModules.jsx'
function App(){
	return (
	...
	...
	)
}
export default App
```

This is the main entry point of our application where we start to code.

# JavaScript XML (J.S.X.)

J.S.X is a convenient way to write code where we write both JavaScript and HTML code in the same file.

There are a few differences:
* `class` is replaced by `className`, as `class` is a reserved keyword
*  You can write `html` just like any other code. It exists as a JS object.
*  To insert a dynamic element, we use `{}`. Inside them, any JS code can be written.
